# portscanner
portscanner for class


This is a simple port scanner.

Hosts can be added as an arguments following the program:

Ex.
  'python prtsnc.py host1 host2 host3 ...'

If no hosts are written as above, the user will be prompted to enter a single host.

The user will then be asked for a port. A single port can be entered individually, or
a range of ports can be submitted, separated by a dash:

Ex.
  80 OR 0-1024

Finally, options will be given to select the protocol, simply enter the number of the protocol which you
wish to use.
